- [] Complete README.md


## Data Acquisition (Linh)
- [X] Create a acquire.py file

## Data Preparation (Carl)

- [x] Assign variables to each team member
- [X] Assign final function to {Carl}
- [] Create list of feature engineering for 1st iteration
- [] Create list of feature engineering for future iterations

# Data Wrangling (Linh)
- [X] Assign to {Linh}
- [X] import acquire.py and prepare.py
- [X] combine acquire and prep mother functions into one clean wrangle.py

## Data Exploration (Tyler)
- [X] split data for exploration
- [X] Univariate exploration and visualizations
- [] Bivariate exploration and visualizations
- [] Multivariate exploration and visualizations
- [X] Create minimum 4 initial hypotheses
    - H1: The mean rate of work interference is equal across all company sizes.
    - H2: That ease of taking leave has no impact on the rate of work interference.
    - H3: That the mean rate of work interference is equal across all responses for 'benefits'.
    - H4: That the mean rate of work interference is not dependent on 'anonymity'.
    - H5: That the mean rate of work interference is not dependent on 'remote_work'.
    - H6: That the mean rate of work interference is not dependent on 'seek_help'.
    - H7: That the mean rate of work interference is not dependent on 'co-workers'.
    - H8: That the mean rate of work interference is not dependent on 'supervisor'.
    - H9: Family history of mental illness no impact on the rate of work interference.
    - H10: Understanding your care options for mental healthcare no impact on the rate of work interference.
