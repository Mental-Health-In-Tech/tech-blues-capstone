    "#### Univariate 1st Iteration - Key Findings, Takeaways, and Next Steps:\n",
    "- `gender` is heavily imbalanced, with 70% of respondents being male. What kind of impact will this have? Are men more/less likey to seek treatment and/or have mental health issues that lead to workplace interference?\n",
    "- `self-employed` is also heavily imbalanced, with only 10% reporting being self-employed. Does this group have more/less issues than those working for others?\n",
    "- `family_history` is 60% no history, 40% history. Interesting to see so many showing a history of mental-illness...(could this be a potential driver???).\n",
    "- `treatment` is almost evenly split. Will be very interested to see if this is a driver - Does receiving treatement lead to more or less interference?\n",
    "- `work_interfere` our target variable is split 60-40, will need to explore over/under-sampling methods to improve model accuracy.\n",
    "- `company_size` has multiple peaks and valleys. It would be nice if the data wasn't already binned, so we could possibly bin differently. Also, clustering might play a role in dealing with company size. It appears there will be a relationship with our target, but what it is, is currently unclear.\n",
    "- `remote_work` is roughly 70-30, with most people working in office. Becasue this data is pre-covid, it would be really nice to gather additional data during/post-covid to see what changes have occurred.\n",
    "- `tech_company` represents 80% of our observations, with approx 20% not working in tech. Unclear at this time if we have enough data to make a good comparison between the two groups.\n",
    "- `benefits` is roughly normally distributed with about half of all observations receiving benefits, one-fifth not receiving any, and one-third unsure if they are available. Really interested to learn more about the 'unsure' group. How do they not know? Are they going to stand out compared to the other two groups?\n",
    "- `care_options` are almost uniform in distribution. 'Yes' and 'No' each receive a little over one-third of all responses, and 'Don't know' receives just under one-third. Again, we are very interested in the 'Don't know' group. Does it not matter if care is available because they do not have mental health issues? Or, is this a possible sign of a group not receiving preventative measures that could have a potentially large impact?\n",
    "- `wellness_program` has 60% not having a wellness program, and 20% each either having one, or unsure. Would love to see how this relates to tech vs non-tech jobs, and again, if 'Don't know' is a driver, or just noise.\n",
    "- `seek_help` has 40% not receiving help/resources from their company, and 30% receiving help, and 20% unsure.\n",
    "- `anonymity` shows an overwhelming majority of respondents who are unsure if they would be able to remain anonymous.\n",
    "- `leave` is roughly normally distributed, however most responses are unsure how difficult it would be to take leave due to a mental health issue.\n",
    "- `mental_health_consequence` shows most either do not think their would be consequences, or are unsure\n",
    "- `phys_health_consequence` shows a stark contrast to mental...75% have no fear, 5% worry about consequences, and 20% are unsure. We are really interested to see what leads to these differences.\n",
    "- `coworkers` shows an overwhelming majority are unsure if they would be comfortable speaking with coworkers about personal mental health issues.\n",
    "- `supervisor` shows another stark contrast where most do feel comfortable speaking with a supervisor about mental health issues, even though they are unsure about speaking with coworkers.\n",
    "- `mental_health_interview` shows that the overwhelming majority do not feel comfortable bringing up mental health issues in an interview.\n",
    "- `phys_health_interview` shows that roughly half as many people would be afraid to bring up a physical health issue as a mental one.\n",
    "- `mental_vs_physical` shows an equal amount of yes and no responses, with a larger portion of unsure. These groups definitely need to be looked into.\n",
    "- `obs_consequence` shows 90% of observations have not heard of any consequences from coworkers sharing mental health issues.\n",
    "- `age` is roughly normally distributed around a mean of 32, but has a tail on the upper end. Will be interested interesting to see if we need to bin this data, and how it relates to other variables."
