    "For our capstone project, we will analyze mental health in the workplace for tech employees via a survey taken in 2014. Our goal is to find features for mental health in the technology field that affects work interference. Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts who's mental health will be affected to where there is work interference."

Once we download the file, we will filter for desirable variables of mental health that could interfere with work (benefits, family history, gender, etc.). We will then follow the steps of the data science pipeline to setup the information for our slides presentation."
