    "#### Univariate 1st Iteration - Key Findings, Takeaways, and Next Steps:\n",
    "- `gender` is heavily imbalanced, with 70% of respondents being male. What kind of impact will this have? Are men more/less likey to seek treatment and/or have mental health issues that lead to workplace interference?\n",
    "- `self-employed` is also heavily imbalanced, with only 10% reporting being self-employed. Does this group have more/less issues than those working for others?\n",
    "- `family_history` is 60% no history, 40% history. Interesting to see so many showing a history of mental-illness...(could this be a potential driver???).\n",
    "- `treatment` is almost evenly split. Will be very interested to see if this is a driver - Does receiving treatement lead to more or less interference?\n",
    "- `work_interfere` our target variable is split 60-40, will need to explore over/under-sampling methods to improve model accuracy.\n",
    "- `company_size` has multiple peaks and valleys. It would be nice if the data wasn't already binned, so we could possibly bin differently. Also, clustering might play a role in dealing with company size. It appears there will be a relationship with our target, but what it is, is currently unclear.\n",
    "- `remote_work` is roughly 70-30, with most people working in office. Becasue this data is pre-covid, it would be really nice to gather additional data during/post-covid to see what changes have occurred.\n",
    "- `tech_company` represents 80% of our observations, with approx 20% not working in tech. Unclear at this time if we have enough data to make a good comparison between the two groups.\n",
    "- `benefits` is roughly normally distributed with about half of all observations receiving benefits, one-fifth not receiving any, and one-third unsure if they are available. Really interested to learn more about the 'unsure' group. How do they not know? Are they going to stand out compared to the other two groups?\n",
    "- `care_options` are almost uniform in distribution. 'Yes' and 'No' each receive a little over one-third of all responses, and 'Don't know' receives just under one-third. Again, we are very interested in the 'Don't know' group. Does it not matter if care is available because they do not have mental health issues? Or, is this a possible sign of a group not receiving preventative measures that could have a potentially large impact?\n",
    "- `wellness_program` has 60% not having a wellness program, and 20% each either having one, or unsure. Would love to see how this relates to tech vs non-tech jobs, and again, if 'Don't know' is a driver, or just noise.\n",
    "- `seek_help` has 40% not receiving help/resources from their company, and 30% receiving help, and 20% unsure.\n",
    "- `anonymity` shows an overwhelming majority of respondents who are unsure if they would be able to remain anonymous.\n",
    "- `leave` is roughly normally distributed, however most responses are unsure how difficult it would be to take leave due to a mental health issue.\n",
    "- `mental_health_consequence` shows most either do not think their would be consequences, or are unsure\n",
    "- `phys_health_consequence` shows a stark contrast to mental...75% have no fear, 5% worry about consequences, and 20% are unsure. We are really interested to see what leads to these differences.\n",
    "- `coworkers` shows an overwhelming majority are unsure if they would be comfortable speaking with coworkers about personal mental health issues.\n",
    "- `supervisor` shows another stark contrast where most do feel comfortable speaking with a supervisor about mental health issues, even though they are unsure about speaking with coworkers.\n",
    "- `mental_health_interview` shows that the overwhelming majority do not feel comfortable bringing up mental health issues in an interview.\n",
    "- `phys_health_interview` shows that roughly half as many people would be afraid to bring up a physical health issue as a mental one.\n",
    "- `mental_vs_physical` shows an equal amount of yes and no responses, with a larger portion of unsure. These groups definitely need to be looked into.\n",
    "- `obs_consequence` shows 90% of observations have not heard of any consequences from coworkers sharing mental health issues.\n",
    "- `age` is roughly normally distributed around a mean of 32, but has a tail on the upper end. Will be interested interesting to see if we need to bin this data, and how it relates to other variables."

    "\n",
    "- Key Findings:\n",
    "    - Best feature performance was with the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```mental_health_interview, mental_health_consequences, care_options, supervisor, benefits, gender, leave, family_history, treatment```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Conceptually, we want to build a model that predicts cases of work interference. We want to maximize true positives and minimize false negatives (Type II error). F1 score is a score that weights false negatives higher while not weighting true negatives as much. Since we want a model that predicts work interference to then do a feature analysis on it, people who don't exerience work interference does not provide much value.\n",
    "    - Hyperparameters were determined using a GridSearchCV with 5 k-folds. \n",
    "    - Best model on validate and train using F1 score is the MLPClassifier, but since it is a black box estimator and we are dealing with sensitive data, we may want to use a white box estimator. \n",
    "        - Random Forest is the least overfit out of the models, and performed almost as well as XGBoost. XGBoost was very overfit even with cross validation. \n",
    "- Takeaways:\n",
    "    - We will use the Random Forest Classifier due to it's generalizability, simplicity, and its transparency. \n",
    "        - It had predicted both classes the best according to F1 score and also will be simpler to perform a feature analysis on it\n",
    "        - While the MLPClassifier had the least false negative/positive rates, its nature as a black box estimator and the nature of our data creates problems with transparency. We want to be respectful and concientious about how these features affect people's mental health and performance at work. \n",
    "- Next Steps:\n",
    "    - Use the model on out of sample data"

    "    - Key Findings:\n",
    "        - The model performed very well on out of sample data. There is an increase of almost 22 percentage points compared to baseline\n",
    "        - It predicted instances of work interference close to 82% correctly\n",
    "        - More importantly, it only incorrectly classified 18% of positive cases of work interference\n",
    "        - It improved on both f1 scores on the test data compared to the validation data\n",

    "        - Family history and seeking treatment are things that businesses don't have much control over, but they can provide resources and support to people who request those things. \n",
    "        - Being open to talking with a supervisor about mental health issues is a stronger factor compared to something like ease of getting leave from work. Having that mentorship role and support reduces work interference. \n",
    "        - Observing consequences due to mental health issues is another factor that drives work interference. Observing others get in trouble or have consequences due to mental health would be stressful for someone who is currently struggling. \n",
    "        - Having benefits only weakly impacts the data, but this could be due to how little mental health coverage is actually included in healthcare plans. \n",
    "        - Gender is weak, but this could be due to the extremely small sample size of gender:'other'\n",
