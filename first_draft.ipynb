    "    - Best feature performance was with the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```mental_health_interview, mental_health_consequences, care_options, supervisor, benefits, gender, leave, family_history, treatment```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Conceptually, we want to build a model that predicts cases of work interference. We want to maximize true positives and minimize false negatives (Type II error). F1 score is a score that weights false negatives higher while not weighting true negatives as much. Since we want a model that predicts work interference to then do a feature analysis on it, people who don't exerience work interference does not provide much value.\n",
    "    - Hyperparameters were determined using a GridSearchCV with 5 k-folds. \n",
    "    - Best model on validate and train using F1 score is the MLPClassifier, but since it is a black box estimator and we are dealing with sensitive data, we may want to use a white box estimator. \n",
    "        - Random Forest is the least overfit out of the models, and performed almost as well as XGBoost. XGBoost was very overfit even with cross validation. \n",
    "- Takeaways:\n",
    "    - We will use the Random Forest Classifier due to it's generalizability, simplicity, and its transparency. \n",
    "        - It had predicted both classes the best according to F1 score and also will be simpler to perform a feature analysis on it\n",
    "        - While the MLPClassifier had the least false negative/positive rates, its nature as a black box estimator and the nature of our data creates problems with transparency. We want to be respectful and concientious about how these features affect people's mental health and performance at work. \n",
